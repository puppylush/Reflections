What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I inititalise a repository, a .git file is created. I need to do it to allow git to start tracking files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is a place to put files before commiting to the repository. It is useful as a check.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
git add the files that comprise a logical change to the staging area then use git diff to ensure that all the changes are reevant to the one change being committed.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I inititalise a repository, a .git file is created. I need to do it to allow git to start tracking files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is a place to put files before commiting to the repository. It is useful as a check.

Lesson 3 reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In case of working remotely on a project with others, wanting files to be accessible from different machines in different locations, or wanting remote backup of files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are working collaboratively, you may not want your work to be overwritten by the changes of others on an ad hoc basis.

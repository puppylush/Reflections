Lesson 3 reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In case of working remotely on a project with others, wanting files to be accessible from different machines in different locations, or wanting remote backup of files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are working collaboratively, you may not want your work to be overwritten by the changes of others on an ad hoc basis. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

GitHub allows forking of repositories - making a copy of another users repository for editing. Git repos can be locally cloned, making an exact copy. Branching code creates a label for some changes which will not alter the master version of a repository unless specifically merged back in. Forking is a good way to build on the work of another without altering the original. Cloning is a good way to see an exact copy of a project without altering the original, or to start work on editing from a known up to date position. branching is useful for experimentation or discrete changes, or when working collaboratively on a repo.
